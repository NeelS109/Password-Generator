# Password-Generator

Description: The password generator will create a random password using the criterea provided when answering the prompts.

How it works:

When the user clicks the button "Generate Password" they are first prompted for password length. The user can choose a password between the range of 8-128. If outside the range, the user is prompted to once again enter a password length within the range. The prompt will loop until the user enters a valid number.

The generator then prompts the user to accept if they would like to include numbers, special characters, uppercase and/or lowercase letters. If the user selects none to all prompts, the program will ask it to select at least one and will loop back through the prompts.

When all parameters have been defined, the password will appear inside the password box.
